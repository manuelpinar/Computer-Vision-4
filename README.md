Perceptions Systems - Classification Algorithms (BDregree in Electronic Engineering)


Two classification algorithms (with matlab) for data in two
dimensions The algorithms will be:
1.- K-Means
2.- ISODATA in any of its variants

The entry to the system will be in the form of pairs of vectors of a row and N columns of
so that the first vector corresponds to the variable of the abysses and the second one to the
of ordered In response the system must show the distribution of points indicating
With the color the class to which each point has been assigned.
You must assume that the number of classes C is known a priori and you have to define this one
Parameter so that it is easily modifiable in order to test the behavior of the
algorithms based on the data entered and by different values ​​of C.
In order to test the operation of your programs you have at your disposal one
set of data in the dades.mat file. You will find this file in the same place where you have it
found this statement This file is a Matlab workspace in which they are defined
the coordinates of 267 points in the XY plan. You can see in figure 1 the distribution of this points.

In Figure 2 you can see the same points as in Figure 1, labeled with colors
according to the class to which they belong originally. Three clouds of points are distinguished
corresponding to three classes in red, green and blue with 84, 119 and 59 points
respectively. In addition, there are 5 points in magenta that are not associated with any
class in concrete This second figure can be used as an orientation to know if they are
Your algorithms work correctly. However, your implementations do not they have to recover exactly the original classes.
